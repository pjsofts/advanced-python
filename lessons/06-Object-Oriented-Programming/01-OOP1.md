Let's start with the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

### Classes and Objects:

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. Here's an example:

#### Creating a simple class:

```python
class Car:
    # Constructor / Initialization method
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    # Method to display car details
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")

# Creating an instance (object) of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022)

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(car1.make)  # Output: Toyota
car1.display_info()  # Output: 2022 Toyota Corolla
```

### Explanation:

- `class Car:`: Defines a class named `Car`.
- `__init__(self, make, model, year)`: The constructor method initializes the object's attributes (`make`, `model`, `year`).
- `self`: Refers to the instance of the class (similar to `this` in other languages).
- `display_info(self)`: A method that displays the car's information.

#### Class Attributes vs. Instance Attributes:

- **Class Attributes:** Attributes shared by all instances of a class.
  
  ```python
  class Car:
      wheels = 4  # Class attribute
  
  car1 = Car()
  car2 = Car()
  print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 4
  print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4
  ```

- **Instance Attributes:** Attributes specific to each instance.
  
  ```python
  class Car:
      def __init__(self, make, model):
          self.make = make  # Instance attribute
          self.model = model  # Instance attribute
  
  car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
  car2 = Car("BMW", "X5")
  print(car1.make)  # Output: Toyota
  print(car2.make)  # Output: BMW
  ```

### Inheritance:

One of the pillars of OOP is inheritance, where a new class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. 

#### Example of Inheritance:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} - Vehicle")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model} {self.year} - Car")

car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022)
car.display_info()  # Output: Toyota Corolla 2022 - Car
```

### Explanation:

- `class Vehicle:`: Defines the base class `Vehicle`.
- `class Car(Vehicle):`: Defines the `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle`.
- `super().__init__(make, model)`: Calls the constructor of the superclass (`Vehicle`) to initialize `make` and `model`.

This is a basic overview of creating classes, objects, inheritance, and the use of constructors and methods in Python's object-oriented paradigm. OOP in Python provides a way to create clean, reusable, and modular code by organizing data and functionality into classes and objects.
