In Python, generators are a type of iterable that allows you to generate a sequence of values dynamically. They are defined using a function with one or more `yield` statements inside them. When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator called a generator.

Here's an example of a simple generator function that generates a sequence of numbers:

```python
def number_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

# Using the generator function
gen = number_generator(5)

# Iterating through the generator
for num in gen:
    print(num)
```

In this example:

- `number_generator` is a generator function that yields numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- `yield` is used to produce a value and temporarily suspend the function's execution, maintaining its state.
- `gen = number_generator(5)` creates a generator object `gen` that will produce numbers from 0 to 4 when iterated upon.
- The `for num in gen:` loop iterates through the generator, printing each number generated by the `number_generator` function.

Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on the fly and don't store the entire sequence in memory. Instead, they produce values one at a time when requested, making them useful for working with large datasets or infinite sequences.

You can also create generators using generator expressions, which are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets:

```python
# Generator expression
gen = (x for x in range(3))

# Using the generator expression
for num in gen:
    print(num)
```

Generators are powerful in Python and are commonly used for lazy evaluation, handling large datasets, and simplifying code by using a more efficient way to produce sequences of values.
