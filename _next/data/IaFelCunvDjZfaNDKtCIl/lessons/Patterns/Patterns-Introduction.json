These patterns are not specific to Python but are general programming concepts applied within the Python language.\n\nSome commonly encountered design patterns in Python include:\n\n### 1. **Creational Patterns:**\n   - **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.\n   - **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.\n\n### 2. **Structural Patterns:**\n   - **Decorator Pattern:** Allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically.\n   - **Adapter Pattern:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.\n   - **Composite Pattern:** Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.\n  \n### 3. **Behavioral Patterns:**\n   - **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\n   - **Iterator Pattern:** Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.\n   - **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.\n\n### 4. **Concurrency Patterns:**\n   - **Thread Pool Pattern:** Manages a pool of worker threads to perform a number of tasks concurrently.\n   - **Producer-Consumer Pattern:** Helps manage multiple threads that are producing data and others consuming it.\n\n### 5. **Architectural Patterns:**\n   - **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Separates an application into three interconnected components: Model (data and logic), View (UI), and Controller (manages user input).\n   - **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** Similar to MVC but emphasizes the separation between the view and the model through a ViewModel that exposes methods and properties to be consumed by the view.\n\nThese patterns aim to address specific concerns and provide proven solutions to recurring problems encountered during software development. They contribute to creating more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code by promoting good design practices and code organization.\n\nIt's essential to understand these patterns to effectively structure your code, enhance code readability, maintainability, and scalability in Python or any other programming language. Libraries like `itertools` or frameworks like Django also implement certain design patterns to provide efficient solutions for common tasks.","slug":"Patterns-Introduction","title":"Patterns","section":"Patterns","icon":"dumpster-fire","filePath":"/home/runner/work/advanced-python/advanced-python/lessons/02-Patterns/01-Patterns-Introduction.md","nextSlug":"/advanced-python/lessons/Patterns/Patterns-Implementation","prevSlug":"/advanced-python/lessons/Generators/Generators-Exercises"}},"__N_SSG":true}
