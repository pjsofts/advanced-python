While Flask doesn't enforce a specific architecture, there are recommended practices that can help organize your code effectively. Here's a commonly used structure:\n\n### 1. **Project Structure:**\n\n- **Root Directory:**\n  - `app.py` or `run.py`: Entry point to start the Flask application.\n  - `config.py`: Configuration settings for the app.\n  - `requirements.txt`: File listing all Python dependencies.\n\n- **Application Package:**\n  - Create a package directory (e.g., `app/`) to organize your Flask app's components.\n\n### 2. **Folder Structure Inside 'app/' Directory:**\n\n- **`__init__.py`:** Initialize the Flask application and set up app-wide configurations.\n- **`models/`:** Define database models using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.\n- **`views/` or `routes/`:** Define route handlers or views for different parts of the application.\n- **`services/`:** Implement business logic or services that handle complex operations.\n- **`forms/` or `schemas/`:** Define forms or schemas for data validation and serialization.\n- **`static/`:** Store static files such as CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.\n- **`templates/`:** Store HTML templates (if using server-side rendering).\n\n### 3. **Separation of Concerns:**\n\n- **Models:** Define database models and handle interactions with the database.\n- **Views/Routes:** Implement route handlers that handle HTTP requests, interact with services, and render responses.\n- **Services:** Implement business logic to perform complex operations. Services can interact with models and other external APIs.\n- **Forms/Schemas:** Define data structures for input validation, serialization, and deserialization.\n- **Static/Templates:** Store files for front-end components if using server-side rendering.\n\n### 4. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Blueprints:** Use Flask's blueprints to organize routes into separate modules for better modularity.\n- **Middleware/Extensions:** Include middleware for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.\n- **Configuration Management:** Use different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.\n- **Testing:** Implement unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests to ensure the application's reliability.\n- **Documentation:** Document your code, endpoints, and usage wherever necessary to aid future maintenance.\n\n### Example Project Structure:\n\n```\nmy_flask_app/\n│\n├── app/\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   ├── models/\n│   ├── views/\n│   ├── services/\n│   ├── forms/\n│   ├── static/\n│   └── templates/\n│\n├── config.py\n├── requirements.txt\n└── run.py\n```\n\n### Note:\n- This structure is a guideline; adjust it based on your project's specific requirements and preferences.\n- As the application grows, consider dividing functionalities into separate modules or packages for better organization.\n\nOrganizing your Flask application with a clear structure helps in managing complexity, making it easier to maintain, test, and extend the application as it evolves.","slug":"Flask-Structure","title":"Flask Structure","section":"Flask","icon":"info-circle","filePath":"/home/runner/work/advanced-python/advanced-python/lessons/05-Flask/01-Flask-Structure.md","nextSlug":"/advanced-python/lessons/Flask/Flask-Application","prevSlug":"/advanced-python/lessons/Fast API/FastAPI"}},"__N_SSG":true}
